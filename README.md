# AI Finance Agent (stub)

This repository contains a scaffold for an AI-powered personal finance agent built with Next.js App Router. The structure is a minimal starting point with API route stubs, components, Prisma schema, and basic helpers.

Structure:

- `app/` — Next.js app routes and pages
- `components/` — UI components and chart stubs
- `lib/` — helper utilities (prisma, auth, agent, analytics)
- `prisma/` — Prisma schema
- `styles/` — global CSS

Quick start (macOS):

```bash
cd "$(dirname \"$0\")"
npm install
npx prisma generate
npm run dev
```

Fill `.env` with `DATABASE_URL` and any API keys required.
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
